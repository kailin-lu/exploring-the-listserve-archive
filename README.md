# Exploring the Listserve Archive

The Listserve was an email project run from 2012 - 2018. Each day a random subscriber of the listserve was chosen to write 
to the 20k other members over email. 

Check out the [original project](http://thelistserve.com/) and the [archived posts](https://thelistservearchive.com/). 

This project aims to explore the question "What do people have to say to twenty thousand strangers over the internet?"
